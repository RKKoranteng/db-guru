## DBGuru's open-source codebase and curriculum
DBGuru is being built as a community where you can learn database administration for free. It's run by [Richard Koranteng](https://rkkoranteng.com) to help busy adults transition into tech. Prior to building DBGuru, Richard spent 10+ years helping aspiring database admins get their first DBA job.

Our tools and curriculum is completely free and self-paced. We're in the process of adding more courses, interview materials, and interatcive database challenges to help you upskill.
