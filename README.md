## DBGuru's open-source codebase and curriculum
[DBGuru](https://dbguru.rkkoranteng.com) is being built as a community where you can learn database administration for free. Our goal is to help aspiring database admins transition into tech.

Our tools and curriculum are completely free and self-paced. We're in the process of adding more courses, interview materials, and interatcive database challenges to help you upskill.

## Roadmap
Our roadmap typically looks out 12 months and we establish topics we want to work on. We'll develop our roadmaps based on previous roadmap, the findings we made over the course of the last year, and of course what we hear from you in issues and feature requests.

When we execute on our roadmap, we keep learning and our assessment of some of the topics listed changes. As a result, we may add or drop topics as we go.
